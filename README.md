## My process

This was my fifth challenge here and I say, building grid is fun since you can do many layouts^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

I learned that by creating this website, this challenge, I saw that I can easily accomplish projects if I put focus on it, and really put my effort doing it

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
